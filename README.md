# BFI Predoctoral Fellow Orientation (Fall 2022)

Welcome to the Bekerman-Friedman Institute! During this orientation we will brief
you in about the tools we believe will help you the most in your RAship at BFI.
We have prepared a set of 1 hour to 2 hours sessions about general programming
topics and career and work environment talks. During this orientation you will
interact with the admin team, other predoctoral fellows, current Ph.D. students

related to your first days at BFI. Please reach out to maskinner@uchicago.edu
